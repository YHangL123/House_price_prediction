# House Price Visualization and Prediction

The purpose this project is to show user the house price range in different plots and predict the house price for varies requirements.


## Description

First of all, this project uses a crawler program to collect nearly 30,000 pieces of housing price information in Beijing. 
The raw data came from China's well-known real estate transaction information website Lianjia and Anjuke (similar to the apartments website). 
In the data cleaning part, blank data and extreme data are removed to get better data visualization and house price prediction.
For the convenience of users, we use the tkinter package to create a graphic user interface (GUI) for user interaction. 
Users can choose the housing data they want to know in our interface, such as the built year, floor, size, area of the house and other factors. 
After the user selects the data, a series of visual data will be provided to let the user understand the distribution and trend of housing prices in Beijing.
